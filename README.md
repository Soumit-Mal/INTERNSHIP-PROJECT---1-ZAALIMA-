Project Overview:
This project analyzes agricultural data across India, integrating regional classification and geolocation (latitude and longitude). It explores trends in crop yield, rainfall, fertilizer and pesticide usage, and seasonal patterns. Visualizations were built using Python and Power BI to support data-driven agricultural decision-making.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Languages & Libraries:
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for static visualizations

Plotly – for interactive and geospatial visualizations

GeoPandas (optional) – for spatial data processing

Visualization & Reporting:
Power BI – for interactive dashboards and geo-maps

Dataset Features:
Crop-wise data including:
Crop, Crop_Year, Season, State, Area, Production,
Annual_Rainfall, Fertilizer, Pesticide, Yield, Region, Latitude, Longitude
